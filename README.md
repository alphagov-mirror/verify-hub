=======

The goal of the Verify Hub Architecture is to provide a long term flexible and scalable solution for GOV.UK Verify. In order to achieve this, the system is a Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) using REST and principles borrowed from the concept of microservices.

The system is divided into logical microservices â€“ with one or more services that provide the functionality required to implement the Hub SAML Profile. Some of the separation is due to logical differences between the components, while other separation is base on security aspects of the service. The eventual goal for this system is for each of these components to be independently deployable and live in separate code bases.

1. Frontend Services: [verify-frontend](https://www.github.com/alphagov/verify-frontend/)
2. Proxy Services: saml-proxy, saml-soap-proxy
3. Business Services: config, saml-engine, policy
4. Stub Services: stub-idp, test-rp,
5. Private Beta Support: token-service
6. Hub Support Services: event-sink, audit, billing
7. Relying Party Support: matching-service-adapter (MSA), verify-service-provider (VSP)

# Architectural Descision Records and documentation

We record our architectural decisions in `doc/adr`. We use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to help manage these decisions.

**Answers to some questions can be found on the [hub wiki](https://github.com/alphagov/verify-hub/wiki)**

## Microservices

This repository contains the core Verify Hub microservices (README files for each are linked below):

* [policy](hub/policy/README.md)
* [config](hub/config/README.md)
* [saml-proxy](hub/saml-proxy/README.md)
* [saml-soap-proxy](hub/saml-soap-proxy/README.md)
* [config](hub/config/README.md)

When running hub locally [stub-event-sink](stub-event-sink/README.md) is used in place of event-sink in `ida-hub-support`

## Prerequisites
The following software is required (installation notes follow)

1. Java 8 JDK (Oracle)
2. Git
3. Gradle
4. Intellij Community (Ultimate is fine as well)
5. Node.js
6. Ruby, with rbenv

### Java 8 JDK (Oracle)

  * Mac:
```
Get Installable from: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Once Installed Set JAVA_HOME Environment Variable (required by Gradle)
Example: In mac add line to .bash_profile:
export JAVA_HOME='/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/{your jdk version}/Contents/Home/'
```

  * Linux:
```
Detailed installation instructions can be found on Stack Overflow:
http://askubuntu.com/questions/56104/how-can-i-install-sun-oracles-proprietary-java-jdk-6-7-8-or-jre
Set JAVA_HOME environment variable in .bash_profile or similar (required by Gradle):
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/{your-jdk-version}
```

### Gradle
  Either install Gradle, or use gradle wrapper
  * **Option 1 - Install Gradle**
    (ensure that you have gradle 4.0)

      * Mac: using homebrew
```
brew install gradle
```
      * Linux:
```
Manual install: http://www.gradle.org/downloads
Extract from zip, add gradle /bin directory to PATH environment variable in .bash_profile or similar.
```

  * **Option 2 - Use Gradle Wrapper**
  The core hub repo contains an instance of Gradle Wrapper which can be used straight from here without further installation. To use, call the ./gradlew script from core hub's root directory

### Node.js
  * Linux (Ubuntu)
```
Due to an ubuntu package name conflict, node was renamed to nodejs in apt
sudo apt-get install nodejs
Create symlink to restore original command name
ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

### Ruby

There are some build scripts within the hub project that use ruby,
plus you'll require Ruby in order to use verify-puppet (Puppet and ops
tools) and the verify-boxes (infrastructure as code: VMs, firewalls, VPNs
etc) repo.

To avoid polluting your system ruby installation and to allow
switching between different Ruby versions, you should install rbenv
and then use that to install Rubies.

#### On Mac

Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if you haven't already, then `brew
install rbenv`

#### On Linux

You probably want to follow the instructions to install
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and
[ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)

#### Then, on all machines

```
rbenv global 2.4.2
```

## Configuration

### Gradle

The hub build.gradle runs a parallel build. The number of parallel forks used when running integration tests can be configured by setting the environment variable ```ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_IDA_HUB_MAX_PARALLEL_FORKS``` (defaults to number of cores if not set). For example:

```export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_IDA_HUB_MAX_PARALLEL_FORKS=4```

## Start Development
From root core hub directory:
(replace gradle with ./gradlew if using gradle wrapper)

Run the build
```
gradle build
```

Setup IntelliJ Project files
```
gradle idea
```

## Before Committing
Run pre-commit script (build, unit test, package)
```
./pre-commit.sh
```

## Running Locally
To spin up hub services to test on your local machine
```
./startup.sh
```

To spin up all services in the Verify federation, clone [verify-local-startup](https://github.com/alphagov/verify-local-startup) as a sibling of verify-hub
```
cd ../verify-local-startup
./startup.sh
```
